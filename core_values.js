That alone makes it hard to enforce a lot of tightly-coupled workflows during the day, but that's a feature, not a bug. Most of the work you do at UpYouth shouldn't require you to be in constant communication throughout the entire day with someone. This could also mean always asking “Can I communicate this through Basecamp?” whenever a task or new idea appears.",
